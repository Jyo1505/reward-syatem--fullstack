IMPORTANT NOTE: while deploy the project i used railway( for db) render(for backend ) and vercel(for frontend)
All platforms i used are free tier so basically while using the site while click on link refresh the page first ( for awaken the backend) .
dont rush if it dont response immediately wait for bit cause(as per free tier it will take time) for response to your requests like login regiter etc
